let gamePlay = (function(){
  
  setUserBoard(gon.user_board);

  // Scan all moves contained on each board. Do I recalculate if each move to see if it hits a ship then apply appropriate class (again)?

  // When user clicks a div.cell on opponent's board, see if it shits ship, then change class accordingly. Send info back to server to add move to board. Backend then calculates opponent's move and sends it back to this view. OR do I have to write the AI in JS?
